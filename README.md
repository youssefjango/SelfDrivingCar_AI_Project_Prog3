# SelfDrivingCar_AI_Project_Prog3

This is the final project of the GUI course in Computer Science and Mathematics at Vanier College. 
It was made by Youssef Ben Mouny, Elyes Bradai and David Tang. 
The purpose of doing this project was more than just learning about GUI, which was done during the entirety of the semister.
It was also done for the purpose to learn about Artificial Intelligence. In fact, this project consists of self-learning cars that race in a track.

# About the project
First the user sets some parameter to make a specific type of cars. When they hit a border of the track, they crash. Then, the car that survived the most in the track will be accounted the best car of the generation. This means that his model will be transmitted to the next generation and so on.

# Tested Methods
public void testSigmoid() ✓ <br />
public void testRelu() ✓ <br />
public void testTanh() ✓ <br />
public void testClone() *of the hiddenlayer class* ✓
